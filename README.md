# ☕ Coffee Maker Program using Python OOP

Welcome to the **Coffee Maker** project — a fun and interactive console-based application that simulates a coffee machine. This program is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. It allows users to order drinks, checks for ingredient availability, handles payments, and reports the machine's current status.
